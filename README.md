## TASK 1 : CONTENT MANAGEMENT

A Content Management System (CMS) website built using React typically involves creating a dynamic and interactive user interface for managing digital content. Here's a brief description of the basic functions you mentioned:

1. **Dashboard:**
   - Upon logging in, users are directed to a dashboard that provides an overview of the content.
   - Key statistics, recent updates, and alerts may be displayed for quick reference.

2. **Content Listing:**
   - Users can view a list of existing content such as articles, pages, or media items.
   - The listing may include relevant information like title, date created, and author.

3. **Edit Content Page:**
   - Clicking on a specific content item opens an editor page.
   - The editor is built with React components, allowing users to modify the content seamlessly.
   - Rich text editors or markdown editors may be integrated for a user-friendly content editing experience.

4. **Modify Content Page:**
   - In addition to basic editing, users may have the ability to modify various attributes of the content, such as metadata, categories, or tags.
   - Changes are reflected in real-time within the editor, providing immediate feedback.

5. **Version Control:**
   - Implement versioning to track changes made to content over time.
   - Users can review and revert to previous versions if needed.

6. **Media Management:**
   - Integrate features for uploading, managing, and selecting media files (images, videos, documents) within the content.
   - Provide options for embedding or linking media in the content.

7. **User Permissions:**
   - Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
   - Different roles (e.g., admin, editor, contributor) may have varying levels of access.

8. **Search and Filtering:**
   - Include a search functionality to quickly find specific content.
   - Filtering options based on categories, tags, or date ranges can enhance content organization.

9. **Notifications:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert users about important updates, comments, or workflow status changes.

10. **Responsive Design:**
    - Ensure that the CMS is responsive and accessible across various devices, facilitating content management on the go.

11. **API Integration:**
    - Connect the React front end to a backend server using APIs for seamless data exchange and real-time updates.

12. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement security features such as HTTPS, input validation, and secure authentication to protect user data and the content management system.

This description outlines the core features of a basic content management website using React, providing users with a user-friendly and efficient platform for creating and managing digital content.
